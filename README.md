-**Import**: import Tippy from '@tippyjs/react';
-**CSS**: import 'tippy.js/dist/tippy.css';
## State Variables

### `addcart` and `setAddCart`
- **Purpose**: This state holds the list of items that have been added to the shopping cart.
- **Initialization**: It is initialized as an empty array, indicating that the cart is empty initially.
- **Usage**: The `setAddCart` function is used to update the state when items are added to or removed from the cart.

### `addedItems` and `setAddedItems`
- **Purpose**: This state keeps track of the IDs of items that have been added to the cart to prevent duplicate additions.
- **Initialization**: It is initialized as an empty array.
- **Usage**: The `setAddedItems` function updates this state whenever a new item is added to ensure no duplicates are added.

### `ProDetail` and `setproDetail`
- **Purpose**: This state holds the details of a selected product to display on the product detail page.
- **Initialization**: It is initialized as an empty array.
- **Usage**: The `setproDetail` function updates this state with the details of the selected product.

### `searchQuery` and `setSearchQuery`
- **Purpose**: This state holds the current value of the search input field.
- **Initialization**: It is initialized as an empty string.
-**Usage**: The `setSearchQuery` function updates this state as the user types in the search bar.

### `filteredItems` and `setFilteredItems`
- **Purpose**: This state holds the list of products that match the search input.
- **Initialization**: It is initialized as an empty array.
- **Usage**: The setFilteredItems function updates this state with the filtered products based on the search input.  

## Functions

### `addToCart`
- **Purpose**: Adds a new item to the cart.
- **Parameters**: `data` (the item to be added).
- **Implementation**: It uses the `setAddCart` function to update the `addcart` state with the new item.

### `handleAddToCart`
- **Purpose**: Handles the addition of items to the cart, ensuring no duplicates.
- **Parameters**: `item` (the item to be added).
- **Implementation**:
  - Checks if the item's ID already exists in the `addedItems` state.
  - If the item is already in the cart, it shows an error message using `toast.error`.
  - If the item is not in the cart, it calls `addToCart` to add the item and updates the `addedItems` state with the new item's ID.

### `QuntityHandler`
- **Purpose**: Adjusts the quantity of a specific item in the cart.
- **Parameters**: `item` (the item whose quantity is being adjusted), `value` (the value to adjust the quantity by, e.g., +1 or -1).
- **Implementation**:
  - Maps through the `addcart` state to find the item.
  - Adjusts the quantity by the given value, ensuring it stays within the range of 1 to 10.
  - Updates the `addcart` state with the new quantities.

### `handleDelete`
- **Purpose**: Removes an item from the cart based on its index.
- **Parameters**: `index` (the index of the item to be removed).
- **Implementation**:
 - Creates a copy of the `addcart` state.
 - Removes the item at the given index using `splice`.
 - Updates the `addcart` state with the new list.

### `ProductShow`
- **Purpose**: Displays the details of a selected product.
- **Parameters**: `item` (the item whose details are to be displayed).
- **Implementation**: Updates the `ProDetail` state with the details of the selected product.

### `handleSearchChange`
-**Purpose**: Filters the product list based on the search input.
-**Parameters**: event (the input change event).
-**Implementation**:Updates the searchQuery state with the current value of the input field.

## Rendering and Routing
The `App` component uses `BrowserRouter` to handle client-side routing. Inside the `BrowserRouter` component, different routes are defined using the `Routes` and `Route` components:

- **`Navbar`**: Displays the navigation bar and passes relevant props for cart functionality.
- **`Home`**: The landing page component which includes the banner and categories.
- **`GirlsTopCards`, `GirlsDressCard`, `GirlsTrousersCard`**: Components to display product cards for different categories.
- **`ProductDetailePage`**: Component to display detailed information about a selected product.

Each route specifies a path and the corresponding component to be rendered. For instance, the home route (`'/'`) renders the `Home` component, and the product detail route (`'/Product/:id'`) renders the `ProductDetailePage` component with the product details.

## Conclusion
By organizing the state and functions in this manner, the `App` component efficiently manages the e-commerce platformâ€™s cart functionality and product displays while ensuring a smooth user experience.
